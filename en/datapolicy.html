The entity responsible for Germany is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. Through Google AdSense, personal data and information such as your IP address are transferred to Alphabet Inc. in the USA for the purpose of recording and billing the advertisements displayed. The USA is an unsafe third country. However, Alphabet Inc. has voluntarily certified itself under the US-EU Privacy Shield Agreement, thereby committing itself to comply with EU data protection regulations. Under certain circumstances, Alphabet Inc. may pass on your personal data to third parties.</p><p>Google AdSense is based on an algorithm that selects the ads displayed on our website to match our content. Google AdSense allows an interest-based targeting of all visitors, which is done by creating individual user profiles. Google AdSense uses cookies for this purpose. By every single call of a page of our website, on which a component of Google AdSense was integrated, your browser on your end device is automatically prompted to transmit data to Google AdSense for the purpose of online advertising and the billing of commissions. Thus Google AdSense receives knowledge about personal data which serve Google AdSense to determine the kind of the advertising to be played and to be able to reconstruct the clicks on this advertising. Among other things Google AdSense can recognize that you have clicked on the advertisement on this website. </p><p>Google AdSense also uses tracking pixels, a thumbnail graphic that is embedded in websites to enable log file recording and log file analysis, which enables statistical analysis. By means of the embedded pixel-code, Google AdSense can detect whether and when a website was opened by you and which links you clicked on. </p><p>The legal basis for the processing of personal data with your consent is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO.</p><p>You can give your consent via our cookie banner and revoke it in the settings at any time with effect for the future. </p><p>‍</p><p>    4.<strong> Google Analytics </strong></p><p>We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google LLC (www.google.de), 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (&quot;Google Analytics&quot;) on our website and App. The entity responsible for Germany is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.</p><p>Google Analytics uses methods that enable an analysis of your use of the website and the app, in particular from which website you came to our website or app (so-called referrers), which subpage you access or how often and for how long you view a subpage. Google Analytics uses cookies for this purpose. Every time you call up a page on our website and our app on which Google Analytics has been integrated, your browser on your end device is automatically prompted to transmit data to Google Analytics for analysis. </p><p>The generated information about your use of our website and our app can also be transferred to a Google LLC server in the USA and stored there. The USA is an unsafe third country. However, Google LLC has voluntarily certified itself under the US-EU Privacy Shield Agreement and has thus committed itself to comply with EU data protection regulations.</p><p>By activating IP anonymization on our website and our app, the IP address is shortened before transmission within the member states of the European Union or in other states that are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. The anonymised IP address transmitted by your browser within the framework of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data.</p><p>Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our website and our app by you and our other users, to compile reports on the activities within our website and our app and to provide us with further services related to the use of our website and app and the use of the internet.</p><p>The legal basis for the processing of personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO.

Thus, your data is usually processed for market research and advertising purposes, among other things, to create corresponding user profiles and to display personalised advertising to you. For this purpose, the social network provider usually stores cookies on your end device, in which your usage behaviour and interests are stored. In addition, the social network provider may process the most important data of the computer system from which you visit it - for example your IP address, the type of processor used and browser version including plug-ins. <br/>If you are logged in with your personal user account of the respective network during the visit of such a network, this network can assign the visit to your account.

To send our newsletter we use the newsletter delivery service MailChimp, which is operated by Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE #5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA (&quot;Mailchimp&quot;). We transmit data to MailChimp in the USA as described below. The USA is an unsafe third country. However, MailChimp has voluntarily certified itself under the US-EU Privacy Shield Agreement and is committed to comply with EU data protection regulations.</p><p>Our newsletter appears regularly and contains information about new offers on our website and news about us.</p><p>To register, you must provide us with your e-mail address. You can voluntarily give us additional information, such as your name. The registration takes place in a so-called double opt-in procedure. After registering on our website, you will receive a confirmation e-mail from us in which you must confirm your registration once again. This entire process is documented and stored. This includes the storage of the registration and confirmation time as well as your IP address. The collection of this data is necessary so that we can trace the processes in the event of misuse of the e-mail address and therefore serves as a legal safeguard. By subscribing to our newsletter, you agree to receive it.</p><p>The legal basis for the processing of your data after registration for the newsletter is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO, if you have given your consent.</p><p>Your data is stored on the servers of MailChimp in the USA. MailChimp uses this information to send and evaluate the newsletter. The evaluation takes place on our behalf, but MailChimp may also use the data for quality assurance and quality improvement of its own services.</p><p>So the &quot;web-beacon&quot; contained in the newsletter is retrieved from the server of MailChimp when the newsletter is opened. In the context of this retrieval, information about the browser, your system, your IP address and the time of the retrieval is collected. Additionally, information is collected if the newsletter is opened, when it is opened and which links are clicked. For technical reasons this information can be assigned to you as the recipient. However, it is not our intention to observe you as an individual user. The evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users in principle and to adapt our content to all users or to send different content according to the interests of our users.</p><p>You can revoke your consent to the storage and use of your personal data to receive the newsletter and the statistical survey described above at any time with effect for the future. To revoke your consent, you can use the link provided for this purpose in the newsletter.</p><p>Your data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required for the purpose of their collection. Your e-mail address will therefore be stored for as long as your subscription to the newsletter is active. </p><p>Further information on data protection can be found in the privacy policy https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/ of MailChimp. </p><p>    8. <strong>E-Mail </strong></p><p>On our website and our app we provide information due to legal regulations, which enable a quick electronic contact to us and a direct communication with us. This includes above all our e-mail address. If you contact us by e-mail, the personal data you provide will be stored automatically. </p><p>The legal basis for the processing of data transmitted in the course of sending an e-mail is Art. 6 Par. 1 letter f DSGVO. If the purpose of the contact is the conclusion of a contract, the additional legal basis for processing is Art. 6 para. 1 letter b FADP.</p><p>However, we use the personal data provided by you exclusively for the processing of your concrete inquiry. The data provided will always be treated confidentially.</p><p>Your details may be stored in a customer relationship management system (so-called CRM system) or another organisation tool for customer data.</p><p>The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary for the purpose for which they were collected. For personal data sent by e-mail, this is the case when the respective conversation with you has ended. The conversation is finished when it can be concluded from the circumstances that the matter in question has been finally clarified. </p><p>If you contact us, you can object to the storage of your personal data at any time. In such a case the conversation cannot be continued.</p><p>    9. <strong>Webflow</strong></p><p>We use the contact form of Webflow, Webflow Inc, 398 11th Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA (&quot;Webflow&quot;) to process customer inquiries via our website.
